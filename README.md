# YASR

It was just a run-of-the-mill roguelike. 
It was a high-school project that I wrote in about a week. I loved writing the texts for it, but, given that only my friends were going to see it (teacher would focus on the code, of course), it was left unpolished.
It had the usual — upgrading your stats (used dices to calculate the damage — you were able to upgrade both amount of dices and number of their sides), fighting monster after monster, killing the Dark Lord and taking his throne… Oh, and save-load system, too. Decided to add it after much nagging from a friend. 

Sadly, my notebook died and took source files with it. So, to save at least something, here is EXE file. I can guarantee you, there are no worms in it, only mighty dragons! ;)
